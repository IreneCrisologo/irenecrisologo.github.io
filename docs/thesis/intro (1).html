<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>During the second world war, when radio engineers noticed that aircrafts were interfering with communication signals of the US Navy, they came up with a brilliant idea of using pulses of radio waves for target detection <span class="citation">(Rinehart <a href="#ref-rinehart_radar_1991">1991</a>)</span>, and thus RADAR (<strong>Ra</strong>dio <strong>D</strong>etection and <strong>R</strong>anging) was born. As the technology of radars developed, the resolution and detection capabilities also improved, leading to better detection of aircrafts. When military radar operators realized that the large patches of unknown echoes “cluttering” their observations were, in fact, meteorological in origin, meteorology personnel took notice, and a whole new application of radars emerged.</p>

</div>
<p>A weather radar transmits a signal along a path called the <em>radar beam</em>, and the antenna rotates at a constant elevation angle to complete one <em>sweep</em> or <em>elevation scan</em>. The antenna makes a series of sweeps at increasing elevation angles, producing a set of nesting conical surfaces of three-dimensional data called a <em>volume scan</em>. When the radar beams encounter a backscattering target (e.g. rain drops, hail, snow, birds), some of the energy is scattered back to the radar receiver, and is then interpreted as the quantity <em>reflectivity factor</em>. This process is summarized by the radar equation <span class="citation">(Hong and Gourley <a href="#ref-hong_radar_2015">2015</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    P_r = \frac{z}{r^2} \left ( \frac{P_t g^2 \theta \phi h}{\lambda^2}\right ) \left ( \frac{ \pi^3 } {1024 \ln(2)} \right ) |K|^2 l
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where the non-numeric parameters can be classified into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Derived quantities
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_r =\)</span> power received by radar (watts)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r =\)</span> range or distance to target (m)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(z =\)</span> radar reflectivity factor (<span class="math inline">\(mm^6/m^3\)</span>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Radar constants</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_t =\)</span> power transmitted by radar (watts)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g =\)</span> antenna gain</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\theta =\)</span> horizontal beam width (radians)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\phi =\)</span> vertical beam width (radians)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h =\)</span> pulse length (m)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lambda =\)</span> wavelength of radar pulse (m)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assumed values</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|K|^2 =\)</span> dielectric constant for radar targets (usually set at 0.93 for liquid water)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(l =\)</span> loss factor for beam attenuation (assumed to be 1 for if attenuation is unknown)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The equation can be simplified by combining the numeric values, the assumed values, and the radar-specific variables into a single constant <span class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span>, and solve for z, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    z = c_1 P_r r^2
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>The constant <span class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span> depends on a specific radar and its configuration, such that the reflectivity factor <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is calculated based on the two parameters measured by the radar: the amount of power return (<span class="math inline">\(P_r\)</span>) and the range (<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>). This reflectivity factor is a function of the distribution of the rainfall drop sizes within a unit volume of air measured. The reflectivity factor is derived as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    z = \sum_{vol} D^6 = D_1^6 + D_2^6 + D_3^6 + \ldots + D_N^6
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>where D is the drop diameter in mm. The reflectivity factor can take on values across several orders of magnitudes (from 0.001 mm<span class="math inline">\(^6\)</span>/m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> for fog to 36,000,000 mm<span class="math inline">\(^6\)</span>/m<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> for baseball-sized hail). To compress the range of magnitudes to a more comprehensible scale, the reflectivity factor is typically converted to decibels of reflectivity (dBZ) or simply <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    Z = 10 \log_{10} \left (\frac{z}{mm^6/m^3} \right )
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Rain rate is also derived from drop-size distribution, such that we can relate reflectivity (<span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>) and rain-rate (<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>) into a so-called Z–R relation of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    Z = A \cdot R^b
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>A</em> and <em>b</em> are empirically derived constants. This bridge between the radar reflectivity measured aloft and the estimated rain-rate allows us to actively observe and monitor rainfall from distances far from the station (as far as 250 km) even before it hits the ground.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The good and the bad</h2>
<p>Weather radars bridged the gap between the synoptic scale observations of weather systems and the point scale human observations at weather stations <span class="citation">(Fabry <a href="#ref-fabry_radar_2015">2015</a>)</span>. They allow for an understanding of atmospheric processes at the mesoscale, such as internal cyclone structures; the evolution of cyclones and tornadoes; the conversion from ice to water in the atmosphere; and cloud microphysics, among many other things. Fabry highlights the importance of weather radar applications by the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Weather radars can predict the type, timing, location, and amount of precipitation, which are the most important components of weather forecasts <span class="citation">(Lazo, Morss, and Demuth <a href="#ref-lazo_300_2009">2009</a>)</span>;</li>
<li>They can detect hazardous weather conditions, such as hail, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes; and</li>
<li>Weather radar data is available in real-time, enabling access to spatiotemporally high resolution weather information.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with any instrument, however, weather radars are not infallible to errors. Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:fig1">1.1</a> illustrates the different factors that could affect the integrity of radar measurements .  classified these error sources into nine categories: radar miscalibration; radar signal attenuation by rain; ground clutter and anomalous propagation; beam blockage; variability of the rainfall-rainrate (Z–R) relation; range effects; vertical variability of the precipitation system; vertical air motion and precipitation drift; and temporal sampling errors.</p>
<p>Radar (mis)calibration contributes the most to the deterioration of rainfall estimation accuracy . This is no surprise, as the exponential nature of the Z–R relationship means that a slight change in reflectivity could mean a big change in the estimated rain-rate. The standard Marshall-Palmer Z–R relationship can be used to demonstrate how the rain-rate estimates from reflectivity change depending on varying degrees of calibration biases (Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:ZRbias">1.2</a>. The effects of calibration bias are minimal at the lower range reflectivities. However, even a 1 dB change in bias could mean a difference of 25 mm/hr for the higher reflectivity ranges, which usually means intense rainfall, even though 1 dB accuracy is already considered well-calibrated. A seemingly small 3 dB underestimation could already mean that a 100 mm/hr rain—which could trigger landslides and/or flash floods—would have been measured as only 65 mm/hr. Such inaccuracies at the higher end of the reflectivity range could be disastrous. In the case of flood forecasting, for example, rainfall estimation errors could further accumulate throughout hydrologic and flood models, deeming event prediction no longer reliable.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Calibration</h2>
<p>Calibrating weather radars became routine soon after the discovery of its meteorological use. In 1951, the Weather Radar Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered disparities between radar estimates and gauge measurements, which led them to research radar calibration <span class="citation">(Atlas <a href="#ref-atlas_radar_2002">2002</a>)</span>. Traditional attempts at radar calibration made use of standard targets with known backscattering properties, such as BB gun pellets fired into radar beams; metalized ping pong balls dropped from light aircraft; or metalized spheres suspended from balloons or helicopters. While such physical methods work well for single-radar calibration and monitoring, they however pose challenges for networks of tens or hundreds of radars. Auxiliary instruments for calibration, such as radar profilers and disdrometers, measure drop size distribution at the same time as the radar. The corresponding reflectivities from the drop size distribution measured by the disdrometers and the reflectivity measured by the radar are then compared for consistency <span class="citation">(Joss, Thams, and Waldvogel <a href="#ref-joss_accuracy_1968">1968</a>; Ulbrich and Lee <a href="#ref-ulbrich_rainfall_1999">1999</a>)</span>. However, since radars measure precipitation aloft while disdrometers measure drop size distribution on the ground, the sample volumes between those two instruments can differ by as much as eight orders <span class="citation">(Droegemeier et al. <a href="#ref-droegemeier_hydrological_2000">2000</a>)</span>. The height difference between these sample volumes mean that external factors such as wind and temperature can change the microphysical characteristics of the droplets that reach the disdrometer, e.g. drop size change through fusion/breakup, change of state through melting.</p>
<p>Relative calibration (defined as the assessment of reflectivity bias between two radars) has been gaining popularity, in particular the comparison with spaceborne precipitation radars (SR) (such as the precipitation radar on-board the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; 1007-2014; <span class="citation">Kummerow et al. (<a href="#ref-kummerow_tropical_1998">1998</a>)</span>) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM; 2014-present; <span class="citation">Hou et al. (<a href="#ref-hou_global_2013">2013</a>)</span>). The precipitation radars on-board these satellite platforms are calibrated to within 1 dBZ <span class="citation">(Kawanishi et al. <a href="#ref-kawanishi_trmm_2000">2000</a>; Takahashi, Kuroiwa, and Kawanishi <a href="#ref-takahashi_four-year_2003">2003</a>; Furukawa et al. <a href="#ref-furukawa_current_2015">2015</a>; Toyoshima, Masunaga, and Furuzawa <a href="#ref-toyoshima_early_2015">2015</a>)</span>, and hence they are accurate enough to serve as a reference for relative calibration. The measured reflectivities from the on-board spaceborne precipitation radars are matched with the ground radar measurements, where the reflectivities (the primary measured quantity) are compared <span class="citation">(Warren et al. <a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span> or the estimated rainfall from both instruments <span class="citation">(Kirstetter et al. <a href="#ref-kirstetter_comparison_2012">2012</a>; Speirs, Gabella, and Berne <a href="#ref-speirs_comparison_2017">2017</a>; Joss et al. <a href="#ref-joss_variation_2006">2006</a>; Amitai, Llort, and Sempere-Torres <a href="#ref-amitai_comparison_2009">2009</a>; Gabella et al. <a href="#ref-gabella_measurement_2017">2017</a>; Petracca et al. <a href="#ref-petracca_validation_2018">2018</a>)</span> for the same event in areas of overlap for calibration. In addition, a major advantage of relative calibration in contrast to absolute calibration (i.e. minimizing the bias in measured power between an external reference noise source and the radar at hand) is that they can be carried out <em>a posteriori</em>, and this be applied to historical data. The large spatial coverage of spaceborne radars enables the calibration of multiple radars in a large network against a single, stable reference <span class="citation">(Hong and Gourley <a href="#ref-hong_radar_2015">2015</a>)</span>, making them particularly helpful for countries like the Philippines with a sparse rain-gauge network.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> The need for (calibrated) radars in the Philippines</h2>
<p>With over 20 typhoons passing through or near the country annually, there are months when rainy days outnumber dry days. Although people are accustomed to frequent thunderstorms, typhoons, and monsoons, they are still caught by surprise by extreme rainfall events. Tropical Storm Ketsana (locally named as <em>Ondoy</em>) passed through the northern island of Luzon in September 2009, which brought rainfall that exceeded the country’s forty-year meteorological record <span class="citation">(Abon, David, and Pellejera <a href="#ref-abon_reconstructing_2011">2011</a>)</span>. TS Ketsana dumped 350 mm rainfall within six hours, which reached 450 mm after twelve hours in Metropolitan Manila. This unusual amount of rain within a short time period resulted in catastrophic flooding in several cities in the metropolitan area and much of Southern Luzon, leading to an estimated PhP 11 Billion (USD 211 Million) in damages and 464 casualties <span class="citation">(Abon, David, and Pellejera <a href="#ref-abon_reconstructing_2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As a response to the need for better disaster awareness, prevention, and mitigation, a disaster risk reduction program (Project NOAH: Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards, <span class="citation">Lagmay et al. (<a href="#ref-lagmay_disseminating_2017">2017</a>)</span>) was established in July 2012. Within the framework of this project, radar data was visualized and released to a public domain in (near) real-time, that people can access anytime and anywhere. This newly established platform was put to the test a month later, when Metro Manila and the surrounding areas were struck by sustained torrential rainfall brought by the southwest monsoon, which went on for several days. The southwest monsoon (named after the origin of the winds) is a regular natural weather phenomenon that brings significant rainfall from June to September in the Asian subcontinent, lasting for several days or weeks at a time <span class="citation">(Lagmay et al. <a href="#ref-lagmay_volcanoes_2015">2015</a>)</span>. At the same time, Typhoon Haikui was passing north of the Philippines, where its southern portion already carrying winds in the northeast direction enhanced the winds of the southwest monsoon. This typhoon pulled in more warm air and precipitation from the West Philippine Sea towards the western coast of the country, which led to the event named as <em>Habagat of August 2012</em>.</p>
<p>This event, coupled with the recent access to the radar data due to Project NOAH, led to a collaboration with the University of Potsdam. Together, we had a first look at the extent of the rainfall distribution in high resolution through the Subic radar, discussed more in detail in Chapter 2 of this thesis. Apart from the key findings of Chapter 2 about the rainfall distribution, we also learned that the Subic radar estimates are highly underestimating by as much as a third of the rain gauge recordings, for reasons unclear to the authors at the time of writing. This was the first time we were confronted with the idea that the Philippine radars might be experiencing calibration issues. Following these developments, the work carried out in Chapters 3 and 4 allowed for further investigation of the radar biases. With more years of data, a study on the calibration of the Philippine radars can be conducted.</p>
<p>The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) established and began expanding the country’s radar network in 2012. There are 15 operational ground weather radars as of April 2019. This thesis focuses on investigating calibration biases of the two longest-running weather radars of the PAGASA radar network: the Subic and Tagaytay radars (Figure <a href="intro.html#fig:studyareaintro">1.3</a>, which are about 100 km apart and overlap Metro Manila, the country’s most populated region.</p>

<div id="the-approach" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> The approach</h2>
<p>This thesis attempts to thread the relative calibration approach together with the concept of data quality. Radar calibration ensures homogeneity in radar networks where comparable measurements of precipitation are essential in the overlapping regions of two or more weather radars. When combining two or more overlapping radar sweeps to produce a composite image, often the basis for selection is data quality.</p>
<p>Data quality is defined in <span class="citation">Michelson et al. (<a href="#ref-michelson_weather_2005">2005</a>)</span> as the <em>“attribute of the data which is inverse to uncertainties and errors, i.e. error-free data with few uncertainties are of high quality while data with errors or large uncertainties are of low quality”</em>. A Quality Index metric classifies the data quality within an interval of 0 to 1, where 0 represents poor quality and 1 represents excellent quality. Quality indices are typically used in combining data from multiple radars to create a composite image over larger regions (e.g. radar composites for a specific catchment, or for an entire country). For bias calibration purposes, quality indices can be used as weights in a weighted-averaging approach for calibration.</p>
<p>In particular, this thesis looks at two factors affecting data quality—beam blockage and path-integrated attenuation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Beam Blockage</strong>: When the topography surrounding a radar interferes with the path of the radar beam, it may partially or completely hinder the radar’s ability to detect the precipitation further along the beam. Such topographic barriers may lead to a weaker backscattered signal. Flat regions within the radar coverage are assigned high data quality. Data quality quickly drops when the radar is blind due to the topographic barriers. This source of uncertainty is considered static, as the obstacles (such as mountains, buildings, or other permanent structures) do not change from scan to scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Path-integrated attenuation</strong>: At wavelengths shorter than 10 cm (such as C-band radars), the radar signal becomes weaker as it passes through rainfall. The magnitude of attenuation is proportional to rain intensity, making it highly variable in space and time. The effects accumulate along the radar beam (hence the term path-integrated). This source of uncertainty is dynamic, as it depends on the rain intensity and therefore changes with every scan.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Determining calibration bias through comparison with spaceborne radars and integrating a quality-weighted approach brings together different threads of the field. Calibration estimation and correction attempts to address systematic errors that are homogeneous over the entire radar domain, whereas factoring in quality allows other sources of systematic errors that are heterogeneous in space to be addressed separately. It is always worthwhile to question the data quality and the reliability, when determining the calibration bias of the ground radar with respect to the spaceborne radar. Poor data quality used in such a comparison may lead to errors in bias estimation, resulting in inaccurate bias correction.</p>

<p>The research questions and the corresponding answers in this thesis were developed in succession. The findings of Chapter 2 (Paper 1) gave rise to the second research question (Chapter 3; Paper 2), whose findings prompted the third research question (Chapter 4; Paper 3). The thesis story starts from the identification of the Subic radar miscalibration, to the quality-weighted calibration bias estimation through SR–GR comparison, and eventually the verification of the method through GR-GR comparison.

<p>The use of radar in operations and research worldwide has been going on for decades. For the Philippines, the radar network has only been collecting and archiving data since 2012. The frequency of typhoons and other convective systems that define the country’s weather provides plenty of research potential in terms of understanding the underlying processes, as well as understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall. To explore the potential role of weather radars in understanding extreme weather in the Philippines, the first research question asks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RQ1</strong>: Can we use recently-acquired weather radar data to reconstruct the enhanced southwest monsoon event of 2012? What additional information can radars provide that are not offered by the rain gauges to explore the spatial distribution of rainfall?</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is answered in the first chapter, where we made an initial attempt at examining the rainfall distribution for the <em>Habagat 2012</em> rainfall event. This was a four-day event of continuous torrential precipitation, brought by southwest monsoon and enhanced further by a typhoon. Twenty-five (25) rain gauges captured the intensity of the event with a maximum accumulated rainfall of 1000 mm. When comparing radar estimates with actual gauge readings, we found that the radar underestimates rainfall by as much as 60%. We adjusted the radar estimates based on the rain gauge values and then produced a gauge-adjusted rainfall map over the Subic radar coverage. We learned from the rainfall distribution map that Manila already received 1000 mm of accumulated rain over the course of four days, whereas most of the accumulated rainfall (~1200 mm) fell over Manila Bay, which was impossible for the rain gauges to capture.</p>
<p>We observed from Chapter 2 that the Subic radar underestimates rainfall compared to the rain gauges, and that rain gauges are unable to adequately capture the spatial distribution of rainfall. Hence there is a need for another source to calibrate the weather radar data. We peered into the possibility of calibration of the Subic radar via spaceborne radars, following the study of <span class="citation">Warren et al. (<a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span> and the method of <span class="citation">Schwaller and Morris (<a href="#ref-schwaller_ground_2011">2011</a>)</span>. In addition, we wanted to explore the added value of considering data quality in comparing the two instruments, which leads to the second research question:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RQ2</strong>: Are SR and GR observations consistent enough to allow for calibration bias estimates? Can we increase the level of consistency by introducing a formal framework for data quality (in terms of measurement quality)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The second chapter looks at the underestimation of the Subic radar discovered in Chapter 1, and suggests a method to adjust the radar estimates in a more systematic manner. The rain gauge density within radar coverage is insufficient to create a reliable basis for adjustment, although it is a common practice as discussed in Chapter 2. Moreover, using gauges for calibration requires the additional step of converting reflectivity to rain rate, which could introduce another layer of uncertainty. In this chapter, we instead turn towards spaceborne radars. We compare the reflectivity measurements of the spaceborne radars with the reflectivity measurements of the ground radars by taking the values only at the volumes where the beams from the two radars intersect adapting the geometry matching method <span class="citation">(Schwaller and Morris <a href="#ref-schwaller_ground_2011">2011</a>)</span>. In addition, we quantify the effect of beam blockage caused by the terrain. We are able to estimate the fraction of the beam being blocked by the terrain and assign a quality index between 0 (bad quality) and 1 (good quality) by modeling the beam blockage map based on a digital elevation model (DEM). We then estimate the bias between SR and GR using the quality index as weights by taking a weighted mean of the differences of the reflectivities from the two instruments. We look at how the comparison of the two radars can be improved (i.e. reduction of the standard deviation) when the data quality based on beam blockage is considered in calibration bias estimation.</p>
<p>Another question is whether the SR–GR calibration method also works for a C-Band radar with a different dominating quality factor (e.g. path-integrated attenuation. The Subic S-Band radar from Chapters 2 and 3 overlaps with the Tagaytay C-Band radar, which sets up the possibility for a three-way comparison between SR (TRMM/GPM), GR (Subic) and GR (Tagaytay), whenever all three datasets intersect in time and space. With this, we ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RQ3</strong>: Can we validate the SR–GR calibration approach by comparing the consistency of two overlapping ground radars before and after bias correction? And can we interpolate the calculated biases to produce a time series of bias estimates and use it to correct historical data for periods when there are no available SR overpasses?</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4 extends the quality-weighting framework by introducing path-integrated attenuation as the basis for data quality. The calculation for PIA is done on the Tagaytay radar, a C-band radar overlapping the Subic radar. The Tagaytay radar was also found to suffer from rainfall underestimation compared to rain gauges <span class="citation">(Crisologo et al. <a href="#ref-crisologo_polarimetric_2014">2014</a>)</span>. C-Band radars are more prone to attenuation, hence the need to consider this source of uncertainty in estimating the calibration bias. In this chapter, we also assess the ability to estimate GR calibration bias from SR overpasses by comparing the reflectivities between Subic and Tagaytay radars before and after bias correction.</p>

<p>Open source software plays a big role in this thesis. All processing steps, from reading the data to creating visualizations were done using wradlib, which was in turn built in Python. <em>wradlib</em> (short for weather radar library) is an open-source library for weather radar data processing. Codes in the form of Jupyter notebooks starting from Chapter 3 were published online through Github, along with sample data, to allow for a transparent view of how the results came to be, and provide a starting point for interested parties who might want to give the procedures a try. The computational procedures are also thoroughly described in the article texts as suggested by <span class="citation">Irving (<a href="#ref-irving_minimum_2016">2016</a>)</span>, which supports the steps towards reproducibility and transparency in atmospheric sciences.</p>
