<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>We explore the potential of spaceborne radar (SR) observations from the Ku-band precipitation radars onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellites as a reference to quantify the ground radar (GR) reflectivity bias. To this end, the 3D volume-matching algorithm proposed by <span class="citation">Schwaller and Morris (<a href="#ref-schwaller_ground_2011">2011</a>)</span> is implemented and applied to 5 years (2012–2016) of observations. We further extend the procedure by a framework to take into account the data quality of each ground radar bin. Through these methods, we are able to assign a quality index to each matching SR–GR volume, and thus compute the GR calibration bias as a quality-weighted average of reflectivity differences in any sample of matching GR–SR volumes. We exemplify the idea of quality-weighted averaging by using the beam blockage fraction as the basis of a quality index. As a result, we can increase the consistency of SR and GR observations, and thus the precision of calibration bias estimates. The remaining scatter between GR and SR reflectivity, as well as the variability of bias estimates between overpass events indicate, however, that other error sources are not yet fully addressed. Still, our study provides a framework to introduce any other quality variables that are considered relevant in a specific context. The code that implements our analysis is based on the open-source software library <em>wradlib</em>, and is, together with the data, publicly available to monitor radar calibration, or to scrutinize long series of archived radar data back to December 1997, when TRMM became operational.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Weather radars are essential tools in providing high-quality information about precipitation with high spatial and temporal resolution in three dimensions. However, several uncertainties deteriorate the accuracy of rainfall products, with calibration contributing the most amount <span class="citation">(Houze et al. <a href="#ref-houze_uncertainties_2004">2004</a>)</span>, while also varying in time <span class="citation">(Wang and Wolff <a href="#ref-wang_comparisons_2009">2009</a>)</span>. While adjusting ground radars (GR) by comparison with a network of rain gauges (also know as <em>gauge adjustment</em>) is a widely used method, it suffers from representativeness issues. Furthermore, gauge adjustment accumulates uncertainties along the entire rainfall estimation chain (e.g. including the uncertain transformation from reflectivity to rainfall rate), and thus does not provide a direct reference for the measurement of reflectivity. Relative calibration (defined as the assessment of bias between the reflectivity of two radars) has been steadily gaining popularity, in particular the comparison with spaceborne precipitation radars (SR) (such as the precipitation radar onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; 1997–2014; <span class="citation">Kummerow et al. (<a href="#ref-kummerow_tropical_1998">1998</a>)</span>) and the dual-frequency precipitation radar on the subsequent Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM; 2014–present; <span class="citation">Hou et al. (<a href="#ref-hou_global_2013">2013</a>)</span>). Several studies have shown that surface precipitation estimates from GRs can be reliably compared to precipitation estimates from SRs for both TRMM <span class="citation">(Amitai, Llort, and Sempere-Torres <a href="#ref-amitai_comparison_2009">2009</a>; Joss et al. <a href="#ref-joss_variation_2006">2006</a>; Kirstetter et al. <a href="#ref-kirstetter_comparison_2012">2012</a>)</span> and GPM <span class="citation">(Gabella et al. <a href="#ref-gabella_measurement_2017">2017</a>; Petracca et al. <a href="#ref-petracca_validation_2018">2018</a>; Speirs, Gabella, and Berne <a href="#ref-speirs_comparison_2017">2017</a>)</span>. In addition, a major advantage of relative calibration and gauge adjustment in contrast to the absolute calibration (i.e. minimizing the bias in measured power between an external or internal reference noise source and the radar at hand) is that they can be carried out <em>a posteriori</em>, and thus be applied to historical data.</p>
<p>Since both ground radars and spaceborne precipitation radars provide a volume-integrated measurement of reflectivity, a direct comparison of the observations can be done in three dimensions <span class="citation">(Anagnostou, Morales, and Dinku <a href="#ref-anagnostou_use_2001">2001</a>; Gabella et al. <a href="#ref-gabella_range_2006">2006</a>, @gabella_using_2011; Keenan et al. <a href="#ref-keenan_comparison_2003">2003</a>; Warren et al. <a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span>. Moreover, as the spaceborne radars are and have been constantly monitored and validated (with their calibration accuracy proven to be consistently within 1 dB) (TRMM: <span class="citation">Kawanishi et al. (<a href="#ref-kawanishi_trmm_2000">2000</a>)</span>,<span class="citation">Takahashi, Kuroiwa, and Kawanishi (<a href="#ref-takahashi_four-year_2003">2003</a>)</span>; GPM: <span class="citation">Furukawa et al. (<a href="#ref-furukawa_current_2015">2015</a>)</span>,<span class="citation">Kubota et al. (<a href="#ref-kubota_evaluation_2014">2014</a>)</span>,<span class="citation">Toyoshima, Masunaga, and Furuzawa (<a href="#ref-toyoshima_early_2015">2015</a>)</span>), they have been suggested as a suitable reference relative calibration of ground radars <span class="citation">(Anagnostou, Morales, and Dinku <a href="#ref-anagnostou_use_2001">2001</a>; Islam et al. <a href="#ref-islam_performance_2012">2012</a>; Liao, Meneghini, and Iguchi <a href="#ref-liao_comparisons_2001">2001</a>; Schumacher and Houze Jr <a href="#ref-schumacher_stratiform_2003">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Relative calibration between SRs and GRs was originally suggested by <span class="citation">Schumacher and Houze (<a href="#ref-schumacher_comparison_2000">2000</a>)</span>, but the first method to match SR and GR reflectivity measurements was developed by <span class="citation">Anagnostou, Morales, and Dinku (<a href="#ref-anagnostou_use_2001">2001</a>)</span>. In their method, SR and GR measurements are resampled to a common 3-D grid. <span class="citation">Liao, Meneghini, and Iguchi (<a href="#ref-liao_comparisons_2001">2001</a>)</span> developed a similar resampling method. Such 3-D resampling methods have been used in comparing SR and GR for both SR validation and GR bias determination <span class="citation">(Bringi et al. <a href="#ref-bringi_comparison_2012">2012</a>; Gabella et al. <a href="#ref-gabella_range_2006">2006</a>; Gabella, Morin, and Notarpietro <a href="#ref-gabella_using_2011">2011</a>; Park, Jung, and Lee <a href="#ref-park_cross_2015">2015</a>; Wang and Wolff <a href="#ref-wang_comparisons_2009">2009</a>; Zhang et al. <a href="#ref-zhang_consistency_2018">2018</a>; Zhong et al. <a href="#ref-zhong_cross-evaluation_2017">2017</a>)</span>. Another method was suggested by <span class="citation">Bolen and Chandrasekar (<a href="#ref-bolen_methodology_2003">2003</a>)</span> and later on further developed by <span class="citation">Schwaller and Morris (<a href="#ref-schwaller_ground_2011">2011</a>)</span>, where the SR–GR matching is based on the geometric intersection of SR and GR beams. This geometry matching algorithm confines the comparison to those locations where both instruments have actual observations, without interpolation or extrapolation. The method has also been used in a number of studies comparing SR and GR reflectivities <span class="citation">(Chandrasekar, Bolen, and Gorgucci <a href="#ref-chandrasekar_microphysical_2003">2003</a>; Chen and Chandrasekar <a href="#ref-chen_validation_2016">2016</a>; Islam et al. <a href="#ref-islam_performance_2012">2012</a>; Kim et al. <a href="#ref-kim_global_2014">2014</a>; Wen et al. <a href="#ref-wen_cross_2011">2011</a>)</span>. A sensitivity study by <span class="citation">Morris and Schwaller (<a href="#ref-morris_sensitivity_2011">2011</a>)</span> found that method to give more precise estimates of relative calibration bias as compared to grid-based methods.</p>
<p>Due to different viewing geometries, ground radars and spaceborne radars are affected by different sources of uncertainty and error. Observational errors with regard to atmospheric properties such as reflectivity are, for example, caused by ground clutter or partial beam blocking. Persistent systematic errors in the observation of reflectivity by ground radars are particularly problematic: the intrinsic assumption of the bias estimation is that the only systematic source of error is radar calibration. It is therefore particularly important to address such systematic observation errors.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that requirement with the example of partial beam blocking. The analysis is entirely based on algorithms implemented in the open-source software library <em>wradlib</em> <span class="citation">(M. Heistermann, Jacobi, and Pfaff <a href="#ref-heistermann_technical_2013">2013</a>)</span>, including a technique to infer partial beam blocking by simulating the interference of the radar beam with terrain surface based on a digital elevation model. Together, that approach might become a reference for weather services around the world who are struggling to create unbiased radar observations from many years of archived single-polarized radar data, or to consistently monitor the bias of their radar observations. We demonstrate the approach in a case study with 5 years of data from the single-polarized S-band radar near the city of Subic, Philippines, which had been shown in previous studies to suffer from substantial miscalibration <span class="citation">(Abon et al. <a href="#ref-abon_evaluating_2016">2016</a>; M.

From the collection of overpasses within these dates, only 183 TRMM overpasses and 103 GPM passes were within the radar coverage.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Ground radar</h3>
<p>The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) maintains a nationwide network of 10 weather radars, 8 of which are single-polarization S-band radars and 2 are dual-polarization C-band radars. The Subic radar, which covers the greater Metropolitan Manila area, has the most extensive set of archived data. The radar coverage includes areas that receive some of the highest mean annual rainfall in the country.</p>
<p>The Subic radar sits on top of a hill at 532 m.a.s.l. in the municipality of Bataan, near the border with Zambales (location: 14.82 <span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>N, 120.36 <span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>E) (see Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:studyarea">3.1</a>). To its south stands Mt. Natib (1253 m.a.s.l.) and to its north run the Zambales Mountains (the highest peak stands at 2037 m.a.s.l.). To the west is the Redondo Peninsula in the southern part of the Zambales province, where some mountains are also situated. Almost half of the coverage of the Subic radar is water, with Manila Bay to its south-east and the West Philippine Sea to the west. Technical specifications of the radar are summarized in Table 3.1. Data from April 2012 to December 2016 were obtained from PAGASA. Throughout the 5 years the scan strategy remained the same, except for 2015 when it was limited to only three elevation angles per volume due to hardware issues. The standard scanning strategy was re-implemented in 2016.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Partial beam shielding and quality index based on beam blockage fraction</h3>
<p>In an ideal situation, SR and GR should have the same measurements for the same volume of the atmosphere, as they are measuring the same target. However, observational differences may arise due to different view geometries, different operating frequencies, different environmental conditions of each instrument, and different processes along the propagation path of the beam. As pointed out before, we focus on beam blockage as an index of GR data quality.</p>
<p>In regions of complex topography, ground radars are typically affected by the effects of beam blockage, induced by the interaction of the beam with the terrain surface resulting in a weakening or even loss of the signal. To quantify that process within the Subic radar coverage, a beam blockage map is generated following the algorithm proposed by <span class="citation">Bech et al. (<a href="#ref-bech_sensitivity_2003">2003</a>)</span>. It assesses the extent of occultation using a digital elevation model (DEM). While <span class="citation">Bech et al. (<a href="#ref-bech_sensitivity_2003">2003</a>)</span> used the GTOPO30 DEM at a resolution of around 1 km, higher DEM resolutions are expected to increase the accuracy of estimates of beam blockage fraction, as shown by <span class="citation">Kucera, Krajewski, and Young (<a href="#ref-kucera_radar_2004">2004</a>)</span>, in particular the near range of the radar <span class="citation">(Cremonini, Moisseev, and Chandrasekar <a href="#ref-cremonini_airborne_2016">2016</a>)</span>. The DEM used in this study is from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, with 1 arc-second (approximately 30-meter) resolution. The DEM was resampled to the coordinates of the radar bin centroids, using spline interpolation, in order to match the polar resolution of the radar data (500 m in range and 1<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> in azimuth, extending to a maximum range of 120 km from the radar site; see Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:studyarea">3.1</a>). A beam blockage map is generated for all available elevation angles.</p>
<p>The beam blockage fraction was calculated for each bin and each antenna pointing angle. The cumulative beam blockage was then calculated along each ray. A cumulative beam blockage fraction (BBF) of 1.0 corresponds to full occlusion, and a value of 0.0 to perfect visibility.</p>
<p>The quality index based on beam blockage fraction is then computed following <span class="citation">Zhang et al. (<a href="#ref-zhang_radar_2011">2011</a>)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\scriptstyle
Q_{BBF} =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; BBF \leq 0.1\\
1 - \frac{BBF - 0.1}{0.4} &amp; 0.1 &lt; BBF \leq 0.5\\
0 &amp; BBF &gt; 0.5
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>A slightly different formulation to transform partial beam blockage to a quality index has been presented in other studies <span class="citation">(Figueras i Ventura and Tabary <a href="#ref-figueras_i_ventura_new_2013">2013</a>; Fornasiero et al. <a href="#ref-fornasiero_effects_2005">2005</a>; Ośródka, Szturc, and Jurczyk <a href="#ref-osrodka_chain_2014">2014</a>; Rinollo et al. <a href="#ref-rinollo_definition_2013">2013</a>)</span> where the quality is zero (0) if BBF is above a certain threshold, and then linearly increases to one (1) above that threshold. It should be noted that these approaches are equally valid and can be used in determining the quality index based on beam blockage.</p>

<p>As expected, the degree of beam blockage decreases with increasing antenna elevation, yielding the most pronounced beam blockage at 0.0<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>. Each blocked sector can be explained by the topography (see Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:studyarea">3.1</a>), with the Zambales Mountains causing blockage in the northern sector, Mt. Natib in the southern sector, and the Redondo peninsula mountains in the western sector. The Sierra Madre also causes some partial beam blocking in the far east, and a narrow partial blocking northeast of the station where Mt. Arayat is located. As the elevation angle increases, the beam blockage becomes less pronounced or even disappears. Substantial blockage persists, however, for the higher elevation angles in the northern and southern sectors.</p>

<p>SR and GR data were matched only for the wet period within each year, which is from June to December. Several meta-data parameters were extracted from the TRMM 2A23 and GPM 2AKu products for each SR gate, such as the corresponding ray’s brightband height and width, gate coordinates in three dimensions (longitude and latitude of each ray’s Earth intercept and range gate index), time of overpass, precipitation type (<em>stratiform</em>, <em>convective</em>, or <em>other</em>), and rain indicators (<em>rain certain</em> or <em>no-rain</em>). The parallax-corrected altitude (above mean sea level) and horizontal location (with respect to the GR) of each gate were determined as outlined in the appendix of <span class="citation">Warren et al. (<a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span>. From the brightband height/width and the altitude of each SR gate, the brightband membership of each gate was calculated by grouping all rays in an overpass and computing the mean brightband height and width. A ratio value of less than zero indicates that the gate is below the brightband, and greater than one indicates that the gate is above the brightband, and a value between zero and one means that the gate is within the brightband. Only gates below and above the brightband were considered in the comparison. <span class="citation">Warren et al. (<a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span> found a positive bias in GR–SR reflectivity difference for volume-matched samples within the melting layer, compared to those above and below the melting layer. They speculated that this was due to underestimation of the Ku- to S-band frequency correction for melting snow. In addition, while usually the samples above the brightband are used in GPM validation, there are significantly more samples below the melting layer, especially in a tropical environment such as the Philippines. To ensure that there are sufficient bins with actual rain included in the comparison, overpasses with less than 100 gates flagged as rain certain were discarded.</p>
<p>For each SR overpass, the GR sweep with the scan time closest to the overpass time within a 10-min window ($$5-min from overpass time) was selected. Both the SR and GR data were then geo-referenced into a common azimuthal equidistant projection centered on the location of the ground radar.</p>
<p>In order to minimize systematic differences in comparing the SR and GR reflectivities caused by the different measuring frequencies, the SR reflectivities were converted from Ku- to S-band following the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
Z(S) = Z(Ku) + \sum_{i=0}^4a_i [Z(Ku)]^i
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>where the <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> are the coefficients for dry snow and dry hail, rain, and in between at varying melting stages (Table 1 of <span class="citation">Cao et al. (<a href="#ref-cao_empirical_2013">2013</a>)</span>). We used the coefficients for snow in the reflectivity conversion above the brightband, following <span class="citation">Warren et al. (<a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The actual volume matching algorithm closely follows the work of <span class="citation">Schwaller and Morris (<a href="#ref-schwaller_ground_2011">2011</a>)</span>, where SR reflectivity is spatially and temporally matched with GR reflectivity without interpolation. The general concept is highlighted by Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:GeometricIntersection">3.3</a>: each matching sample consists of bins from only <em>one SR ray</em> and <em>one GR sweep</em>. From the SR ray, those bins were selected that intersect with the vertical extent of a specific GR sweep at the SR ray location. From each GR sweep, those bins were selected that intersect with the horizontal footprint of the SR ray at the corresponding altitude. The SR and GR reflectivity of each matched volume was computed as the average reflectivity of the intersecting SR and GR bins.%, where the averaging is done in linear units (<span class="math inline">\(mm^6/m^3\)</span>). %The entire workflow of this volume matching procedure is based on wradlib functions and available at <a href="https://github.com/wradlib/radargpm-beamblockage" class="uri">https://github.com/wradlib/radargpm-beamblockage</a>.</p>
<p>The nominal minimum sensitivity of both TRMM PR and GPM KuPR is 18 dBZ, so only values above this level were considered in the calculation of average SR reflectivity in the matched volume. In addition, the fraction of SR gates within a matched volume above that threshold was also recorded. On the other hand, all GR bins are included in the calculation of average GR reflectivity, after setting the bins with reflectivities below 0.0 dBZ to 0.0 dBZ, as suggested by <span class="citation">Morris and Schwaller (<a href="#ref-morris_sensitivity_2011">2011</a>)</span>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Assessment of the average reflectivity bias</h3>
<p>Beam blockage and the corresponding GR quality maps were computed for each GR bin (cf. Section <a href="abstract-2.html#sec:partialbeamblocking">3.3.1</a>. For each matched SR–GR volume, the data quality was then based on the minimum quality of the GR bins in that volume.</p>
<p>To analyze the effect of data quality on the estimation of GR calibration bias, we compared two estimation approaches: a simple mean bias that does not take into account beam blockage, and a weighted mean bias that considers the quality value of each sample as weights. The corresponding standard deviation and weighted standard deviation were calculated as well. The overall process is summarized in Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:MethodFlowchart">3.4</a>. In this way, we provide an overview of the variability of our bias estimates over time.</p>

<p>Consequently, the estimate of the calibration bias substantially depends on the consideration of partial beam blockage (or quality). Ignoring quality (simple mean) yields a bias estimate of -1.9 dB while the quality-weighted average yields a bias estimate of -1.2 dB. Accordingly, the standard deviation is reduced from 3.4 to 2.6 dB, indicating a more precise bias estimate.</p>
<p>This case demonstrates how partial beam blockage affects the estimation of GR calibration bias. At a low elevation angle, substantial parts of the sweep are affected by <em>total</em> beam blockage. The affected bins are either below the detection limit, or they do not exceed the GR threshold specified in Table <a href="#tab:filteringcriteria"><strong>??</strong></a>. As a consequence, these bins will not be considered in the matched samples and will thus not influence the bias estimate, irrespective of using partial beam blockage as a quality filter. At a higher elevation angle, though, the same bins might not be affected by <em>total</em> beam blockage, but by <em>partial</em> beam blockage, as also becomes obvious from Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:BBF">3.2</a>. Considering these bins in the matched samples will cause a systematic error in the estimate of calibration bias, unless we use the partial beam blockage fraction as a quality filter by computing a quality-weighted average of reflectivity. As a consequence, the effect of quality-weighted averaging (with partial beam blockage fraction as a quality variable) can be most pronounced at ``intermediate’’ elevation angles, depending on the specific topography and its location with respect to the ground.</p>

<p>The effect becomes obvious for the next elevation angle. Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:allplotsblackcircles2013110815">3.6</a> is equivalent to Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:allplotsblackcircles2013110805">3.5</a>, but for an elevation angle of 1.5<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>: as the sector of total beam blockage shrinks at that elevation, the impact of partial beam blockage on the estimation of GR calibration bias increases. For an antenna elevation of 1.5<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>, some bins in areas of partial beam blockage have very large negative biases (over 20 dB). Ignoring beam blockage for this elevation angle yields a bias estimate of -2.1 dB (simple mean), while the quality-weighted average yields a bias of -1.4 dB. At the same time, considering quality substantially reduces the standard deviation from 3.4 dB to 2.1 dB.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2</span> Case 2: 01 October 2015</h4>
<p>The second case confirms the findings in the previous section for a GPM overpass on October 1, 2015. That overpass captured an event in the northern and eastern part of the radar coverage where partial beam blockage is dominant, as well as a small part of the southern sector with partial and total beam blockage. Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:allplotsblackcircles2015100110">3.7</a> shows the results of that overpass in analogy to the previous figures, for an antenna elevation of 0.0<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>. The figure shows a dramatic impact of partial beam blockage, with a dominant contribution from the northern part, but also clear effects from the eastern and southern sectors. The scatter plot of <span class="math inline">\(Z_{GR}\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(Z_{SR}\)</span> in Figure @ref(fig:all_plots_2015-10-01_0_0)e demonstrates how the consideration of partial beam blockage increases the consistency between GR and SR observations and allows for a more reliable estimation of the GR calibration bias: ignoring partial beam blockage (simple mean) yields a bias of {-2.7 dB}, while the quality-weighted average bias is -1.1 dB. Taking into account quality decreases the standard deviation from 3.8 dB to 2.7 dB.</p>

<p>As a result, we obtain a time series of bias estimates for GR calibration, as shown in Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:timeseriesallelev">3.8</a>. In this figure, the calibration bias for each overpass is computed from the full GR volume, i.e. including matched samples from all available antenna elevations. In the upper panel (a), each marker represents the quality-weighted mean bias for a specific SR overpass (circles for GPM, triangles for TRMM). The centre panel (b) highlights the differences between the quality-weighted and simple mean approaches, by quantifying the effect of taking into account GR data quality (in this case, partial beam blockage). The bottom panel (c) shows the differences between the quality-weighted standard deviation and the simple standard deviation of differences, illustrating how taking into account GR quality affects the precision of the bias estimates.</p>
<p>The time series provide several important insights.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Effect of quality-weighting on bias estimation</strong>. Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:timeseriesallelev">3.8</a>b and c together illustrate the benefit of taking into account GR data quality (i.e. beam blockage) when we estimate GR calibration bias. It does not come as a surprise that the difference between $Z^* $ and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Z\)</span> is mostly positive because the areas suffering from partial beam blockage register weaker signals (i.e. lower reflectivity) than expected, producing a lower mean bias. Giving the associated volume-matched samples low weights in the calculation of the mean bias brings the quality-weighted bias up. In the same vein, the beam-blocked bins introduce scatter, and assigning them low weights decreases the standard deviation. Figure <a href="abstract-2.html#fig:timeseriesallelev">3.8</a>c shows, as a consequence, that the quality-weighted bias estimates are consistently more precise: in the vast majority of overpasses, the quality-weighted standard deviation is substantially smaller than the simple standard deviation. That result is also consistent with the case study result shown above. It should be noted, though, that for some overpasses, the quality-weighting procedure (which is in effect a filtering) can cause an increase in the bias estimate and/or the standard deviation of that estimate. That effect occurs for overpasses with particularly low numbers of matched samples, and, presumably, with rainfall in regions in which our estimated beam blockage fraction is subject to higher errors (caused by e.g. the inadequateness of the assumed Gaussian antenna pattern, variability of atmospheric refractivity, or errors related to the DEM, its resolution and its interpolation to ground radar bins). In total, however, the effect of decreasing standard deviation vastly dominates. %However, when the matched sample size is already small, further filtering of samples increases the standard deviation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GPM and TRMM radars are consistent</strong>. In 2014, both TRMM and GPM overpasses are available. That period of overlap shows that the GR calibration bias estimates that are based on both TRMM and GPM observations can be considered homogeneous. Using TRMM data, the average calibration bias for all 2014 overpasses amounts to 1.6 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1.3 dB, while using the GPM overpasses yields a bias of 1.8 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1.5 dB. The difference between TRMM version 7 and GPM version 5 reflectivities mentioned in Section <a href="abstract-2.html#subsec:srpr">3.2.1</a> falls within the uncertainties in the annual estimated mean bias, which makes us confident that the substantial year-to-year changes in our bias estimates are based on changes in GR calibration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change in bias over time</strong>: Despite the variability of bias estimates between the individual overpass events, the time series still provides us with a clear signal: the bias estimates appear to fluctuate around an average value that appears to be quite persistent over the duration of the corresponding wet seasons of the different years, i.e. over intervals of several months. Considering the average calibration bias over the different wet seasons (horizontal lines in Figure @ref(fig:timeseries_allelev)a), we can clearly observe changes in calibration bias over time. The bias was most pronounced in 2012 and 2013, with average bias estimates around -4.1 dB for 2012 and -2.5 dB for 2013. For 2014, the absolute calibration bias was much smaller, at a level of 1.4 dB, while for 2015 and 2016, the situation improved further, with an average bias of 0.0 dB in 2015 and 0.6 dB in 2016. It is important to note that these values were computed as the average bias and its standard deviation across all matched volumes and not as the average of bias estimates across overpasses. Accordingly, the standard deviation (as indicated by the dashed lines) is quite high since it includes all the scatter from the individual overpasses. We have to assume that a fundamental issue with regard to calibration maintenance was addressed between 2013 and 2014 in the context of hardware changes (i.e. replacement of magnetron). Unfortunately, we were not able to retrieve detailed information on maintenance operations that might explain the changes in bias of the radar throughout the years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-term variability of bias estimates between overpasses</strong>. There is a strong variability of the estimated calibration bias between overpasses (Figure @ref(fig:timeseries_allelev)a) and spatially within each overpass (@ref(fig:all_plots_2013-11-08_0_5;fig:all_plots_2015-10-01_0_0). That variability is clearly not a desirable property, as we would not expect changes in calibration bias to occur at the observed frequency, amplitude, and apparent randomness. As a consequence, we have to assume that the variability is a cumulative result of various and dynamic sources of uncertainty along the entire process of observation, product generation, matching, and filtering. That assumption is well in line with many other studies (such as <span class="citation">Anagnostou, Morales, and Dinku (<a href="#ref-anagnostou_use_2001">2001</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Durden et al. (<a href="#ref-durden_effects_1998">1998</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Joss et al. (<a href="#ref-joss_variation_2006">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Kim et al. (<a href="#ref-kim_global_2014">2014</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Meneghini et al. (<a href="#ref-meneghini_use_2000">2000</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Rose and Chandrasekar (<a href="#ref-rose_systems_2005">2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Schwaller and Morris (<a href="#ref-schwaller_ground_2011">2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Seto and Iguchi (<a href="#ref-seto_intercomparison_2015">2015</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Wang and Wolff (<a href="#ref-wang_comparisons_2009">2009</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Warren et al. (<a href="#ref-warren_calibrating_2018">2018</a>)</span>, to name only a few) which discuss e.g. fundamental issues with the backscattering model for different wavelengths and sampling volumes; the uncertainty of beam propagation subject to fluctuations in atmospheric refractivity; residual errors in the geometric intersection of the volume samples; uncertainties in SR reflectivity subject to the effects of attenuation correction at Ku-band, non-uniform beam filling and undesirable synergies between the two; rapid dynamics in backscattering target during the time interval between SR overpass and GR sweep; effects of non-meteorological echoes for both SR and GR; and, presumably, also short-term hardware instabilities. Considering these uncertainties, together with the fact that the quality-weighting in our case study explicitly accounts for beam blockage only, the short-term variability becomes plausible. However, it is beyond the scope of this study to disentangle the sources of this variability.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Conclusions</h2>
<p>In 2011, Schwaller and Morris presented a new technique to match spaceborne radar (SR) and ground-based radar (GR) reflectivity observations, with the aim to determine the GR calibration bias. Our study extends that technique by an approach that takes into account the quality of the ground radar observations. Each GR bin was assigned a quality index between 0 and 1, which was used to assign a quality value to each matched volume of SR and GR observations. For any sample of matched volumes (e.g. all matched volumes of one overpass, or a combination of multiple overpasses), the calibration bias can then be computed as a quality-weighted average of the differences between GR and SR reflectivity in all samples. We exemplified that approach by applying a GR data quality index based on the beam blockage fraction, and we demonstrated the added value for both TRMM and GPM overpasses over the 115 km range of the Subic S-band radar in the Philippines for a 5-year period.</p>
<p>Although the variability of the calibration bias estimates between overpasses is high, we showed that taking into account partial beam blockage leads to more consistent and more precise estimates of GR calibration bias. Analyzing 5 years of archived data from the Subic S-band radar (2012–2016), we also demonstrated that the calibration standard of the Subic radar substantially improved over the years, from bias levels of around -4.1 dB in 2012 to bias levels of around 1.4 dB in 2014 and settling down to a bias of 0.6 dB in 2016. Of course, more recent comparisons with GPM are needed to verify that this level of accuracy has been maintained. Case studies for specific overpass events also showed that the necessity to account for partial beam blockage might even increase for higher antenna elevations. That applies when sectors with total beam blockage (in which no valid matched volumes are retrieved at all) turn into sectors with partial beam blockage at higher elevation angles.</p>
<p>Considering the scatter between SR and GR reflectivity in the matched volumes of one overpass (see case studies), as well as the variability of bias estimates between satellite overpasses (see time series), it is obvious that we do not yet account for various sources of uncertainties. Also, the simulation of beam blockage itself might still be prone to errors. Nevertheless, the idea of the quality-weighted estimation of calibration bias presents a consistent framework that allows for the integration of any quality variables that are considered important in a specific environment or setting. For example, if we consider C-band instead of S-band radars, path-integrated attenuation needs to be taken into account for the ground radar, and wet radome attenuation probably as well <span class="citation">(Austin <a href="#ref-austin_relation_1987">1987</a>; Merceret and Ward <a href="#ref-merceret_attenuation_2000">2000</a>; Villarini and Krajewski <a href="#ref-villarini_review_2010">2010</a>)</span>. The framework could also be extended by explicitly assigning a quality index to SR observations, too. In the context of this study, that was implicitly implemented by filtering the SR data, e.g. based on brightband membership. An alternative approach to filtering could be weighting the samples based on their proximity to the brightband, the level of path-integrated attenuation (as e.g. indicated by the GPM 2AKu variables <em>pathAtten</em> and the associated reliability flag (<em>reliabFlag</em>)) or the prominence of non-uniform beam filling (which could e.g. be estimated based on the variability of GR reflectivity within the SR footprint; see e.g. <span class="citation">Han et al. (<a href="#ref-han_establishment_2018">2018</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In addition, with the significant effort devoted to weather radar data quality characterization in Europe <span class="citation">(Michelson et al. <a href="#ref-michelson_weather_2005">2005</a>)</span>, and the number of approaches in determining an overall quality index based on different quality factors <span class="citation">(Einfalt, Szturc, and Ośródka <a href="#ref-einfalt_quality_2010">2010</a>)</span>, it is straightforward to extend the approach beyond beam blockage fraction.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there is still ample room for improvement, our tool that combines SR–GR volume matching and quality-weighted bias estimation is readily available for application or further scrutiny. In fact, our analysis is the first of its kind that is entirely based on open-source software, and is thus fully transparent, reproducible, and adjustable (see also <span class="citation">Heistermann et al. (<a href="#ref-heistermann_emergence_2014">2014</a>)</span>). Therefore this study, for the first time, demonstrates the utilization of wradlib functions that have just recently been implemented to support the volume matching procedure and the simulation of partial beam blockage. We also make the complete workflow available together with the underlying ground and spaceborne radar data. Both code and results can be accessed at the following repository <a href="https://github.com/wradlib/radargpm-beamblockage" class="uri">https://github.com/wradlib/radargpm-beamblockage</a> upon the publication of this paper.</p>
<p>Through these open-source resources, our methodology provides both research institutions and weather services with a valuable tool that can be applied to monitor radar calibration, and—perhaps more importantly—to quantify the calibration bias for long time series of archived radar observations, basically beginning with the availability of TRMM radar observations in December 1997.</p>
